# Minnesota Whist Card Game

Welcome to the **Minnesota Whist** card game project! Inspired by the old-school look of early computing systems, this game focuses on simplicity and strategy.

## Features

- **Bidding Phase**: Players bid on whether they will go "high" or "low" based on their cards.
- **Game Mode**: Depending on the bidding, the game is played in either "HIGH" or "LOW" mode.
- **Trick-taking mechanics**: Players take turns playing cards, and the game follows standard trick-taking rules, where players must follow suit and the highest-ranked card wins the trick.
- **AI Bot Players**: Three bots controlled by the computer will automatically play their turns and handle the bidding process.
- **Endgame Scoring**: The game calculates and displays the score at the end of each round.

Thanks for checking out Minnesota Whist! I designed this project to feel like a blast from the past back when computer usage was a bit more direct and intentional. Enjoy!

## Future Plans

This game is still a work in progress, and I plan to continue refining it and addressing any quirks. Additionally, I aim to use this project for research into incomplete information games (IIGs). I may also explore the possibility of running the game on a Hercules emulator using the JCL compiler.
